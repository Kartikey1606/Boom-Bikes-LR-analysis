> Boom Bikes LR analysis case study Notebooks Problem Statement


## General Information
Background: The research focuses on BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing company that saw a decline in sales as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. In order to plan for revenue acceleration, they want to estimate the demand for shared bikes after the quarantine.

Business Problem: The project's goal is to comprehend the key factors influencing bike demand in the American market. BoomBikes hopes to boost earnings by modifying its company strategy and fulfilling client expectations by creating a predictive model.

Dataset used: The dataset includes daily bike demand statistics for the American market, as well as information on the weather, the time of year, and both casual and registered users' bike rentals.


## Conclusions
- We can observe that the factors listed below have a significant impact on bike demand:

###  spring , winter, December , July , November , Saturday , Light rain_Light snow_Thunderstorm , Mist_cloudy , yr , holiday , windspeed, workingday.

1. Given that the weather is perfect for riding motorcycles, it makes sense that summer is followed by spring.
2. The median for 2019 was higher than it was for 2018, which can be related to the rising popularity of bike rentals and people's increased environmental awareness. 
Annual increases in the median bike rental rate are seen.
3. The overall spread in the month plot mirrors the season plot since the median for the autumn months is higher.
4. People rent more frequently on days other than holidays, which may be a sign that they prefer to drive their own cars and spend time with their family versus renting bikes on holidays.
5. Although the median for all days is the same overall, as can be seen, Friday and Monday have wider spreads.
6. The median is almost the same for working and non-working days, but the range is wider on non-working days since some individuals could have plans and not want to rent bikes on those days.
7. Clear skies are wonderful for renting bikes since they are temperate, have less humidity, and are lower in temperature.
